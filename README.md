## Compositionality in developmental systems.

Repo consists of these folders:

1) Category Theory (precursor to relational biology)

2) Data-Theoretic Paper (setting forth models of processes from data)

3) Polygon Cell Division (process of cell division in an abstract model)

4) Relational Biology (category theory for describing biological processes)
